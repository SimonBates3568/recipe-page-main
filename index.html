  <h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <!--1-->
  <li><b>Beat the eggs:</b> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
    You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>

  <br>

    <!--2-->
  <li><b>Heat the pan:</b>Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>

  <br>

    <!--3-->
  <li>
  <b>Cook the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
    the eggs evenly coat the surface.
  </li>

  <br>

  <!--4-->
  <li><b>Add fillings (optional):</b> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
    middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>

  <br>

  <!--5-->
  <li><b>Fold and serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
    fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>

    <br>

<!--6-->
  <li><b>Enjoy:</b> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
  </li>

  <br>
